# Blazor Notes

+ Do alot of reading of the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/images?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
    + [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69063129/display-image-from-byte-array-in-blazor) is where a person displayed an image by using the data urls.  I'm not sure which is simpler.  Probably need to do examples of both.  Either make a way to select a picture on their computer and display it or some other image generation to show an example of displaying a dynamic image.
